# AngularJS - Get Started

This is my solution for the challenge proposed in Pluralsight's AngularJS - Get Started course by Scott Allen: https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/angularjs-get-started/.

To run locally:
```bash
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

Then in your browser: localhost:8000

NOTE: I'm using AngularJS 1.5.11 as the project has issues with 1.6.6 (to be investigated).
